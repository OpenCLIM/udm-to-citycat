  summary: >
    This model takes the data produced by the urban development model and formats it for CityCat. 
  source_code: https://github.com/OpenCLIM/udm_fabric_generator
  description: >
    The urban fabric generator produces geopackage files defining where new urban development will take place according to the projected
    socio-economic pathways. Dependent on constraints and attractors, some pathways permit the building of new residental buildings in
    existing green spaces. This model takes the existing greenspaces as of 2020 and removes the polygons where future development is to take
    place. It then merges the new greenspaces with the modified existing greenspaces to be uploaded to the city cat model. The new buildings 
    are also merged with existing buildings to be uploaded to the city cat model.
